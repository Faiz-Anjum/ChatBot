# ChatBot
So this script is written in Python 3 and it it a chatbot for an imaginary bakery shop called 'Merryweather Cheesecakes'.
This script takes your order, suggest you something if the thing you are looking for isn't available, or gives you random suggestion about what you would like to try.
At last this script shows you all your ordered items and finishes.
The exe file for windows is inside the dist directory.

**Known issues:**

(i) .exe file is not updated/synchronized with source code.

(ii) Some bugs may occur while ordering more than 10 items in more than one conservative tries.

**New Update**

(i) Optional for enhancing experience: Need to install pyfiglet.

	**installation:** pip install -r requirements.txt    or    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

**Old Updates:**

(i) Source code (ChatBot.py) has been updated and a 'random suggestion' feature has been installed.

(ii) Various bugs fixed and added Time-Sleep function for better design.
